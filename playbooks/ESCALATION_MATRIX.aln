# CommsEthica Escalation Matrix

**Purpose:**  
To govern how incidents, vulnerabilities, and compliance concerns are managed, ensuring prompt mitigation, oversight, and transparent disclosure—all while maintaining public safety.

## Escalation Process

1. **Detection**  
   - Any contributor, user, or auditor may file a concern via `/publication/PUBLIC_RELEASE_NOTE.aln` or email.
2. **Logging & Notification**  
   - All incidents are logged with timestamp, originator, and summary in the audit vault.
   - Notify appropriate roles based on escalation level.
3. **Immediate Action**  
   - Follow required action timelines per table above.
   - All critical actions must be signed by authorized personnel.
4. **Resolution & Follow-up**  
   - Attest remediation via cryptographic signature.
   - Document root cause and final status in public CHANGELOG and audit logs.
5. **Public Notification**  
   - For levels 3–4, follow staged disclosure protocol to the community as specified.

## Contacts and Overrides

- **Escalation Coordinator:** compliance@your-org.example
- **Director Override:** In case of procedural disputes, escalation routes directly to the project director for final decision.
