# CommsEthica

**CommsEthica** is the open, standards-driven repository for secure, ethical neural-network communications on Microchip hardware. This project provides a public resource for engineers, researchers, auditors, and compliance teams focused on safe, reproducible, and transparent AI-assisted communications innovation.

***

## ðŸŒŸ What is CommsEthica?

CommsEthica is a living, auditable toolkit for building, governing, and auditing neural-networked communication systems on Microchip platforms.  
It codifies best practices, technical blueprints, safety guidelines, and compliance checklists for enterprise and public-sector use.

***

## Key Features

- **Governance-Ready Compliance**  
  Machine-verifiable ethical and safety policies, with enforced separation of public and private artifacts.

- **Technical Reference Blueprints**  
  Patterns and implementation guides for Microchip board integration, secure boot flows, and NN communications.

- **Safety-Focused AI Chat Playbooks**  
  Prompt templates, refusal guides, and escalation protocols for responsible AI operation.

- **Reproducible Experiments**  
  Sanitized datasets, immutable audit trails, and forensic attribution built-in.

- **Automation & CI Tools**  
  Automated code signing, provenance stamping, and continuous compliance checks via public CI.
